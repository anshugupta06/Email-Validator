3) Static Domain Protection: Maintains accuracy for popular domains like gmail.com, yahoo.com, outlook.com, ensuring exact matches.

4) Typo Suggestions: Offers intelligent suggestions for common domain typos (e.g., gmial.com ‚Üí gmail.com).

5) Special Character Rules: Validates placement of special characters, ensuring they're not at the start or end.

6) Uppercase Handling: Restricts uppercase letters for domain names to maintain standardization.

7) Responsive UI: Developed using Tkinter with a modern and animated interface for an intuitive user experience.

8) Image Integration: Utilizes Pillow to display images in the GUI.

9) Real-Time Feedback: Provides instant error messages or success confirmations using pop-up alerts.

üîß Tech Stack and Libraries Used:

1) Python: Core programming language.

2) Tkinter: For GUI development and responsive design.

3) Pillow (PIL): To manage and display images.

4) dnspython: To check MX records and verify domain authenticity.

5) difflib: For typo detection and suggesting close matches for domain corrections.

üåê MX Record Verification:
